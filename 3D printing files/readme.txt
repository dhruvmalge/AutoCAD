This is the repo of 3D printing files made in Fusion and Blender. 

So if you want to print this file, just download and open it in any slicer app, Prusa, Bambu, and adjust the setting and tweaks to it.

Tweaks in the sense, print speed, infill ratio, sparse density, supports and beams, lines layers, etc.
